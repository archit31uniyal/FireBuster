The user enters a few parameters that play a crucial part in detecting a forest fire and gets back the predicted values of the same parameters for a 
The parameters are as follows:
1. FFMC- Moisture content in litter and other cured fine fuels.
2. DMC- numeric rating of the average moisture content of loosely compacted organic layers of moderate depth.
3. DC - numeric rating of the average moisture content of deeply compact organic layers.
4. ISI - expected rate of fire spread. 
5. temp - temperature
6. RH- Relative humidity 
7. area

Location of dataset: Monte Sinho 

Dataset consists of weekly analysed data and hence our model performs best on an interval of a week.
